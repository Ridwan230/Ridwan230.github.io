excerpt: 'Ensuring global food sufficiency and security is one of the prime challenges of the twenty-first century. The most effective approach to tackle this challenge is to ensure a healthy agricultural ecosystem. A potential barrier, in this case, would be different diseases that commonly infest and cause great damage to the production. To keep plants disease-free, most countries still rely on human intervention-based approaches. One issue with the mentioned approach is that farmers donâ€™t get the help they need at the right time owing to manpower shortages. This paves the way for the development and implementation of automated mechanisms to detect and classify plant disease. Using heavy-weight convolutional neural network or CNN-driven solutions is often not practical as farmers are not equipped with devices capable of running such heavy applications. This is why lightweight CNN architectures capable of operating mobile and embedded devices are crucial. In this work, we present a comparative analysis and overview of different efficient CNN-based methodologies proposed for plant disease classification. Moreover, we fine-tuned off-the-shelf state-of-the-art efficient CNN architectures using transfer learning to analyze and determine the right balance of model size and accuracy.'
